# InputSystemTest

This is a simple example project that shows switching between two action maps.  The player can move around as a capsule and enter/exit a tank.  The walking and tank controls are set up with two different action maps.  When the player enters or exits the tank, one action map is enabled and the other is disabled.

Actions are set for use with keyboards, gamepads, and cross-platform XR usages.
